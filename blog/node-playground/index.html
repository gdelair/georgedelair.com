                <p>Hey everyone!</p>

                <p>So I finally did it – node playground is live in the App Store!</p>

                <h2>What the heck is this thing anyway?</h2>
                <p>This app is something I have been thinking about for a while but never tried to actually make. I
                    wanted an app where I could poke around, create patterns, and just zone out for a bit when my brain
                    needed a break.</p>

                <p>node playground is basically a physics sandbox where you can create these glowing nodes that connect
                    to each other and respond to your touch. Tap the screen to create a node, hold and drag to push them
                    around, or add special nodes like attractors and repellers that change how everything moves.</p>

                <h2>The cool stuff you can do</h2>
                <p>I ended up adding a bunch of features as I went:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Different node types (the blackhole is my personal favorite)</li>
                    <li>Musical feedback when nodes interact (surprisingly addictive)</li>
                    <li>Motion controls so you can tilt your phone to move everything around</li>
                    <li>A bunch of settings to tweak the experience just how you want it</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Oh, and you can double-tap to create these explosion effects that send shockwaves through the whole
                    system. I definitely spent too much time just doing that over and over.</p>

                <h2>My accidental fidget toy</h2>
                <p>Here's a little confession – I originally made this for myself. I have a hard time focusing
                    sometimes, and I found that having something to do with my hands actually helps me pay attention
                    during meetings or when listening to podcasts.</p>

                <p>node playground turned into my go-to digital fidget. It's subtle enough that I can use it while on a
                    call without getting completely distracted, but engaging enough to keep my hands busy so my brain
                    can focus.</p>

                <h2>Want to try it?</h2>
                <p>You can grab node playground on the App Store now. It's a one-time purchase (no subscription
                    nonsense) because I hate that stuff too.</p>

                <p>If you do check it out, I'd love to hear what you think! Drop a review, send me an email, or hit me
                    up here.</p>

                <p>Thanks for reading, and happy node-ing! (Is that a word? It is now.)</p>
