                <h2>I Built a Fidget App Because I Couldn't Find One That Didn't Suck</h2>

                <p>So here's the thing. I have ADHD. I fidget constantly.</p>

                <p>I went looking for a simple fidget app on my phone and every single one was either loaded with ads,
                    wanted a subscription for some reason, or looked like it was designed for toddlers. I just wanted
                    something clean that I could open, mess around with for a minute, and close. No accounts, no
                    upsells, no "watch this ad to unlock the next fidget."</p>

                <p>Couldn't find it. So I built it.</p>

                <h2>SenseSoothe</h2>

                <p>It's 8 different fidget interactions — toggles, sliders, a spinning wheel, a dial, a tappable grid,
                    stuff like that. Every one has haptic feedback so it actually <em>feels</em> like something when you
                    interact with it. You can turn sounds on or off. Dark mode, light mode. That's it.</p>

                <p>No ads. No tracking. No account. You pay a dollar, you own it, it works offline, and nobody's
                    harvesting your data in the background. I know that sounds like it shouldn't be noteworthy in 2026
                    but here we are.</p>

                <h2>Why It Exists</h2>

                <p>I built SenseSoothe for people like me. Adults who need something to do with their hands during
                    meetings, in waiting rooms, on phone calls, or just when your brain won't stop buzzing. It's also
                    great for anxiety — repetitive tactile stuff is genuinely calming and there's real science behind
                    that.</p>

                <p>But honestly it's for anyone who fidgets. If you're a pen clicker or a rubber band snapper or you've
                    ever caught yourself spinning your phone on the table, this is your app.</p>

                <h2>The Indie Dev Part</h2>

                <p>I'm a solo developer. No team, no funding, no marketing department. Just me, Xcode, and an unhealthy
                    amount of coffee. Building this was the fun part — getting people to actually <em>know</em> it
                    exists is the real challenge.</p>

                <p>I'm actively trying to break my pattern of building things endlessly and never telling anyone about
                    them. If you've ever made something cool and then just... not shared it, you know what I mean. It's
                    weirdly hard to put your stuff out there. But distribution is maybe even more fun than shipping, so
                    here I am.</p>

                <h2>Try It</h2>

                <p>If any of this sounds like you, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sensesoothe/id6758260279"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grab SenseSoothe on the App Store</a>. It's $0.99. If
                    you like it, tell someone. If you don't like it, tell <em>me</em> — I'm always iterating.</p>

                <p>And if you're a fellow indie dev reading this: just ship the thing. Then tell people about it. I know
                    it's scary. Do it anyway.</p>
