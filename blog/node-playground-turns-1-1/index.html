                <p>Hey everyone!</p>

                <p>So I made myself a promise when I launched Node Playground: I'd get the first update out before the
                    app turned one year old. Bold commitment, right? Well, the update is live now — at the 10-month
                    mark. Cutting it a little close there, but hey, a promise is a promise. The next update won't take
                    quite as long. (Probably.)</p>

                <p>Version 1.1 is here though, and honestly it was worth the wait. This one addresses pretty much
                    everything I wanted to fix after launch, plus a feature I didn't even know I needed until I built
                    it.</p>

                <h2>The Big One: Presets</h2>

                <p>This is the headline feature and it changes how you use the app. Node Playground now has a full
                    preset system — you can load up curated configurations like Zen Garden, Deep Space, Morning Rain,
                    and a handful of others with a single tap.</p>

                <p>But here's the part I'm most proud of: you can save your own presets too. Found that perfect
                    combination of node types, audio settings, and visual tweaks that hits just right? Save it. Name it.
                    Come back to it whenever you want. And if you ever mess things up experimenting, there's a Reset
                    Defaults button that puts everything back to square one.</p>

                <p>I built this because I kept finding myself tweaking settings to recreate setups I'd stumbled onto
                    before. Now I just tap and I'm there. Ten months of occasionally thinking "I should really add that"
                    finally turned into actually adding it.</p>

                <h2>Audio That Doesn't Hurt Your Ears</h2>

                <p>Okay, confession time. The audio in 1.0 had some issues. Volume levels were inconsistent — sometimes
                    way too loud — and there was this crackling and popping that would show up on certain devices. Not
                    ideal for something that's supposed to be a calming fidget experience.</p>

                <p>All of that is fixed now. Volume levels are balanced, the crackling is gone, and the overall sound
                    output is just cleaner. It's one of those changes where you might not consciously notice it, but
                    everything feels better.</p>

                <h2>The Usual Suspects</h2>

                <p>There are also the standard bug fixes and stability improvements that come with any update. Nothing
                    dramatic, just smoothing out the rough edges that have been bugging me since launch. (For ten months.
                    While I did nothing about them. We've been over this.)</p>

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>

                <p>I've got ideas. Lots of them. And I promise — <em>promise</em> — the gap between 1.1 and 1.2 will
                    not be ten months. The hardest part of shipping updates is shipping the first one. Now that the
                    muscle is warmed up, expect more frequent releases.</p>

                <p>If you already have Node Playground, the update should be waiting for you. If you haven't tried it
                    yet, now's a great time to jump in — the presets give you a much better starting point than just
                    dropping into a blank canvas.</p>

                <p>As always, I'd love to hear what you think. Drop a review, send me a message, whatever works. And if
                    you save a preset that's particularly cool, tell me about it — I'm always looking for configurations
                    I haven't thought of.</p>

                <p>Happy node-ing!</p>
