                <h2>I Built a Pomodoro Timer Because Every Other One Annoyed Me</h2>

                <p>PomBar is a Pomodoro timer that lives in your Mac's menu bar. You click the tomato, you start a focus
                    session, it counts down, you take a break. That's it. That's the whole app.</p>

                <h2>Why This Exists</h2>

                <p>I tried like six different Pomodoro apps and they all had the same issue — they wanted to be <em>way</em>
                    more than a timer. Project tracking, detailed analytics, team collaboration, Notion integrations,
                    monthly subscriptions. Brother, I just want a countdown in my menu bar. I don't need a productivity
                    platform. I need to know when 25 minutes is up.</p>

                <p>So I built exactly what I wanted.</p>

                <h2>What It Does</h2>

                <p>It times your focus sessions. It times your breaks. It sits in your menu bar so you can see how much
                    time is left without switching apps. You can customize the session lengths. There are keyboard
                    shortcuts if you're into that.</p>

                <p>That's genuinely it. No account, no sync, no analytics dashboard showing you a pie chart of your
                    productivity. Just a timer.</p>

                <h2>What It Doesn't Do</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>No subscriptions. $1.99, you own it, we're done.</li>
                    <li>No tracking. I have zero idea how you use this app and I'd like to keep it that way.</li>
                    <li>No internet required. It's a timer. It doesn't need the cloud.</li>
                    <li>No bloat. It's a menu bar app. It takes up approximately zero space in your life until you need
                        it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The ADHD Angle</h2>

                <p>Real talk — I have ADHD and the Pomodoro technique is one of the few productivity methods that
                    actually works for my brain. Something about knowing there's a visible countdown creates just enough
                    external pressure to keep me on task. And knowing a break is coming makes it easier to start.</p>

                <p>If that sounds familiar, this might be your app.</p>

                <h2>The Indie Dev Angle</h2>

                <p>PomBar is part of my growing family of small, focused apps. I also make <a
                        href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sensesoothe/id6758260279" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">SenseSoothe</a> (a fidget app for your phone) and Node Playground.
                    Same philosophy across all of them — do one thing well, respect your privacy, charge a fair price,
                    and get out of the way.</p>

                <p>I'm a solo dev building these in my spare time. No venture capital, no growth team, no grand plan to
                    monetize your attention. Just tools I wanted that didn't exist yet.</p>

                <h2>Get It</h2>

                <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pombar/id6758595602" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">PomBar on the Mac App Store</a> — $1.99. If you use the Pomodoro
                    technique and you have a Mac, I think you'll like it. And if you don't like it, that's cool too.
                    Probably still cheaper than the coffee you're drinking while you read this.</p>
