            <div class="post-content">
                <p>MonoDraft started as a "I just need something simple" project.</p>

                <p>No accounts. No feeds. No complicated syncing story. Just a clean place to write that doesn't fight me.</p>

                <p>But once I had MonoDraft living in the browser, it felt obvious that the same approach could apply to the other little tools I always end up wanting when I'm trying to focus: a quick task list, a timer that doesn't nag like a cop, and a way to map out a process without opening a heavyweight app.</p>

                <p>So MonoDraft quietly evolved into <a href="https://monosuite.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MonoSuite</a> — a small collection of minimal tools for focused work:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MonoDraft</strong> — writing for posts, docs, notes (with export + focus mode)</li>
                    <li><strong>MonoFlow</strong> — a simple workflow / diagram editor when I need to think visually</li>
                    <li><strong>MonoTask</strong> — lightweight to-dos that stay out of the way</li>
                    <li><strong>MonoTimer</strong> — ADHD-friendly timeboxing with gentle reminders and presets</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Along the way, the whole suite got a style pass too. I leaned into a warmer, more "literary" look — cream backgrounds, terracotta accents, and the Fraunces typeface — plus solid light/dark themes that respect system settings. It's still minimal… it just feels nicer to live in.</p>

                <p>Everything runs locally, saves to your browser, and stays intentionally boring in the best way. The goal isn't to replace your entire productivity stack. It's to give you a few calm tools you can actually use when your brain is already doing too much.</p>

                <p>More soon. For now: <a href="https://monosuite.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MonoSuite</a> exists, it's getting sharper, and it's exactly the kind of software I want around when I'm trying to do real work.</p>
